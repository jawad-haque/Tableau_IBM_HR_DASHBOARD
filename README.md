                                                 🚀 IBM HR DASHBOARD 🚀

What can you learn from 1,470 IBM employees in a single glance?

I built an interactive IBM HR Analytics DashBoard using Tableau Public — slicing through gender balance, department structure, income trends, experience levels, and educational diversity inside IBM.

Starting with a robust dataset from Kaggle, I embarked on a journey of data transformation, employing preprocessing techniques such as creating aliases and filtering to ensure clarity and precision in our findings.

🔍 What’s inside the dashboard:
— Gender split by job role
— Age vs. Department vs. Role visual
— Monthly income comparisons
— Education background overview
— Number of companies worked for
